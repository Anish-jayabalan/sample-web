But one of the patterns that never ceases to exist is expansion across borders. While reflecting on the opportunities in front of us, let\u2019s take a look at Oman which is one of the most popular destinations for relocation.<\/p>\n<p>Oman can be described as a smooth and accessible introduction to the Middle East. It is considered to be one of the safest, and most stable countries in the Gulf Region. Statistically, more than 30% of the population are expats. While the government is working on ensuring that the locals get sufficient employment opportunities, job opportunities are plenty available for expats.<\/p>\n<p>Expats moving to Oman have a few things to keep in mind. While it is genuinely a very culturally and financially rewarding experience, there are certain points to be aware of before you step foot into this country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Work Permit and Visa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The process of sponsoring an expat to work in a local company is taken care of by the employer. The following documents must be acquired by the employer while bringing an expat as an employee to Oman.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employment visa for entry<\/li>\n<li>Resident card to remain in the country<\/li>\n<li>Residence permit<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Oman, these documents have to be procured by employees ( who have received a job offer from an Omani Company) between age 21 and 60. The employer takes the role of the visa sponsor and obtains the vital documents from the Ministry of Manpower.<br \/>\nThe employer obtains individual employment visas for each and every expat who is being sponsored. The employer then submits the application to the Immigration Department of the Royal Oman Police.<\/p>\n<p>One of the conditions to be fulfilled before submitting the visa application is the medical certificate that is required from foreigners of certain countries. The certificate must be obtained from an approved clinic back in the home country. This physical medical fitness certificate confirms if the employee is fit to work in Oman. The same is taken for dependents accompanying the employee to Oman. Attestation by the Ministry of Health is required before submission to the employer.<\/p>\n<p>Once the Oman employee Visa is approved as per Oman Labour law , the next step is obtaining the residence visa. This is so that the employee can legally stay in the country during the tenure of employment. This can be done once the employee reaches Oman.<\/p>\n<p>Oman is currently working on new temporary work permits for expats to permit the recruitment of non-Omani workers under temporary employment licenses in specific specialised jobs for a set period. The specified professions include medical, academic, technical, consultancy, expertise and training, according to the Implementation Support and Follow-up Unit\u2019s annual report.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Omanization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The country emphasizes a specific percentage of Oman citizen being deployed by the travel vendor among the total visa processed for that year. Future Focus Infotech ties up with vendors who have that capability to address this government mandate. There is a omanization charge applied to this mandate, and we ensure to keep this charge to minimal as we have aggregated in volumes towards the deployment of local residents.<\/p>\n<p>Oman is emerging as a significant economic player in the Middle East. Technology runs our lives more than ever, but it is relationships that drive business and commerce, so people will find more ways to connect in person to build trust and strengthen connections. Take your personnel to new heights by exposing them to new territories. With Future Focus Infotech as your partner for global employment, all your staffing solutions will be taken care of. Don\u2019t let technicalities come in the way between you and your global vision.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The new year brings with it new trends and potential for the business to grow.
