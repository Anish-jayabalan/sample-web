The Difference between Robotic Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence is RPA is a software robot that mimics human actions, whereas AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the RPA Tools include Openspan, UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blueprism etc\u2026<\/p>\n<p>PEGA \u2013 Programs in Extra-Galactic Astronomy<\/p>\n<p>PEGA is a software development tool for CRM and BPM Applications. Pega tool is practiced to automate all the process without any coding. Pega allows organizations to deploy changes eight times faster than Java based applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PEGA PRPC :<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PRPC (PegaRULES Process Commander) is a software product created, licensed, and marketed by Pegasystems Inc (PEGA). PRPC is the core component of Pegasystems\u2019s \u201cSmartBPM\u201d suit of BPM (Business Process Management) solutions. Pega\u2019s latest version is 8.2<\/p>\n<p><strong>PEGA RPA (OpenSpan) :<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pega started out as an enterprise for CRM and BPM initially. Later a few years ago, they purchased OpenSpan (in 2016) to incorporate RPA and now known as PEGA RPA<\/p>\n<p>Hence Pega PRPC is different from Pega RPA as Pega RPA has an advanced way of Automation techniques to increase the efficiency and velocity. Pega RPA also requires a knowledge of .Net Framework as OpenSpan is developed using it<\/p>\n<p>So the hunting should be in such a way that it meets both the JD\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore the sourcing can be done towards PEGA RPA as the candidate will be strong in Automation, Database and also .Net Framework with knowledge of Pega PRPC. But Pega PRPC candidate might not be very comfortable as he will be strong only in Automation and Database with a less knowledge of RPA.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Initially got a requirement heading a simple word called Pega Developer.
