Apart from the fact that it is a pleasure to live here, it is also true that Australia has remained untouched by the global financial crisis. The country is a leading tourist destination and its popularity is growing in leaps and bounds. Even though the costs of living here are higher than in most countries, the pay is higher as well. Australia offers some of the best average salaries in the world. One could even double the savings by living here.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to job opportunities, Australia has a shortage of skilled workers. This shortage creates fantastic career opportunities with lucrative pay. The working conditions and perks offered are quite unmatched. These are some very good reasons to work in Australia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expats in Australia<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Australia has one of the largest migration programs with over 0.19 million jobs reserved for permanent migrants. Nearly 70% of this is reserved for skilled migrants under the Skilled Migration Program. Statistics show that the country issues approximately 0.12 million permanent visas dedicated to skilled workers every year. The distribution of these visas depends on the most in-demand skills for that specific year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Work Visa \u2013 Numerous Options<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a constant need for people with specialization and skills in Australia. The growing economy provides enough job opportunities. To accommodate and welcome skilled expats, Australia today offers numerous visa options for workers by issuing visas to workers based on their qualifications or the skill sets that they have. There are visas for temporary or permanent employment and visas sponsored by employers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recognition of your skills and qualifications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Companies in Australia value qualifications and work experience as it provides them with a fresh perspective to their work environment. The SkillSelect Program gave expat job seekers with specialized skills good opportunities to apply. There were five visa subclasses under this program that was initiated in 2013<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skilled Independent visa (Subclass 189)<\/li>\n<li>Skilled Nominated visa (Subclass 190)<\/li>\n<li>Graduate Temporary visa (Subclass 485)<\/li>\n<li>Skilled Nominated or Sponsored visa (Provisional) (Subclass 489)<\/li>\n<li>Skilled Regional visa (Subclass 887)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Applicants to this program were assessed on a points-based system and could qualify for a visa only if they had the required points. It is prudent to stay updated on the requirements and regulations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pension Benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Expats living and working in Australia are entitled to various pension benefits once they meet the residency and age requirements. Individuals working here can explore the benefits of a Superannuation Fund \u2013 a retirement savings account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of work visas<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skilled workers<\/li>\n<li>People participating in specific activities<\/li>\n<li>Working holiday seekers<\/li>\n<li>Specialized workers<\/li>\n<li>Short-term trainees<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apart from this, an expat can also apply for a sponsored visa in which case you will have to find a sponsor or apply to the SkillSelect program with an Expression of Interest. Under the employer nomination scheme, a permanent work visa is given to workers sponsored by their companies. Under the temporary skilled shortage, expats can work between two to four years based on the employee\u2019s requirement. Applicants must have a minimum of two years\u2019 work experience and should be less than 45 years. Organizations taking employees on this visa will pay them the market salary.<\/p>\n<p>An expat can stay in Australia for twelve months to four years depending on the category of the Work Visa. If it is under the RSMS or ENS, they can stay indefinitely as long as they remain sponsored under these schemes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The requirements to work in Australia through the Skilled Visa are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be below 45 years at the time of application<\/li>\n<li>Must possess adequate ability in the English language for working in Australia, minimum a competent level (IELTS\/TOEFL)<\/li>\n<li>The skilled occupation matching the qualifications and skills must be found on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).<\/li>\n<li>The skills must be assessed by the assessing authority in Australia designated to verify the nominated occupation before applying<\/li>\n<li>Must have reasonably good health.
