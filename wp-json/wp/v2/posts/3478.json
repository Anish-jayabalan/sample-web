Businesses and corporate management require obeying legal statutes and regulations with respect to constitutional laws. This covers various concepts such as how the company is managed, how the staff is taken care of and the treatment towards the consumers.<\/p>\n<p>The topic of compliance is to be taken seriously to ensure that corporations act with responsibility. This is vital to every business. And here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of bringing in compliance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Creating a positive reputation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The public image of a company is directly related to its success. Compliance with laws is a factor that speaks for the company more than anything else<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Improving productivity in the company<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When the employees are taken care of well, it creates a positive environment in the workplace thereby enhancing productivity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Building trust in the environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consumer trust is created with compliance with the laws. Court cases due to failure in obedience with the law lead to dropping in sales of products and services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Labour Laws<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Internal compliance concerning safety, remuneration, employee benefits and compensation, etc. play a crucial component in the labour laws. Obeying the laws brings about satisfaction amongst the employees. All complaints and issues are monitored and addressed with diligence before it snowballs into a huge problem and affects the corporation. This works both ways.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Elements of the labour law<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The fundamental subject matter of labour law can be considered under nine broad heads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Employment: Basic component<\/li>\n<li>Individual employment relationships: the making, amendment and termination clauses involved<\/li>\n<li>Wages and remuneration: All forms of compensation and protection of wages against unfair practices<\/li>\n<li>Conditions of work: Ensure a safe environment with appropriate gear, adequate rest and vacations<\/li>\n<li>Health, safety, and welfare: The employees come first. Ensure welfare facilities<\/li>\n<li>Social security: Includes compensation for accidents, maternity leave, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Trade unions and industrial relations: Legal representatives of the employees and protection of their rights<\/li>\n<li>The administration of labour law: Includes labour department, labour inspection services, and other organs of enforcement<\/li>\n<li>Special provisions for particular occupational or other groups: Special provisions with respect to specific occupational and other groups<\/li>\n<li>The labour law insists on maintenance of proper records with respect to salary paid, deductions made at source, filing and all records related to the employment at hand. Be it a Retainer, Contractor or Remote, there must be no gap in the records. The laws will vary based on the kind of contract that is being signed up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Non-compliance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The consequences for non-compliance is more than just paying a fine. It involves jail time for employers as seen recently.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJail time for employers that exploit workers and a national labour-hire licensing scheme was among 22 recommendations called for in a report by Australia\u2019s Migrant Workers\u2019 Taskforce that was accepted Thursday by Australia\u2019s coalition government, according to an announcement by Jobs and Industrial Relations Minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does this imply?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Compliance of labour laws brings with it the protection of those who abide by the law. This means that employers who follow protocol are entitled to many rights. Labour laws clarify and codify business owners\u2019 obligations to their employees. The labour movement has a long history of lobbying for laws that protect workers rights, improve worker safety, prevent child labour and increase workers\u2019 bargaining power relative to their employers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe exploitation of workers in Australian workplaces is not only illegal, but it also harms individuals, undercuts law-abiding employers and reflects poorly on Australia\u2019s international reputation,\u201d O\u2019Dwyer said.<\/p>\n<p>Only the most serious and egregious cases of labour exploitation would be subject to criminal penalties, O\u2019Dwyer said. Not employers that accidentally or inadvertently do the wrong thing.<\/p>\n<p>We at Future Focus Infotech are sticklers for compliance of the local laws of the land.
