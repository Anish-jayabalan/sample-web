One of the greatest shows on Earth bringing together over 180 nations, the international audience for which would be over millions, awaits you. This is a date that would be at the top of your mind if you have won a contract for Expo 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s true that there are almost 800 days to go. Don\u2019t let the number fool you. Time really flies and these days will, leaving you with barely enough time to get your act together for the expo.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing that you have to realise when you are planning for an event abroad is that nothing gets done instantly. It is not just about understanding that it is a time-consuming activity. When you involve external factors, you have to provide the operation with enough time and be prepared for any possible delays that could occur. These delays are beyond your control and can neither be predicted nor prevented. A process that could take 2 days in your calendar would be longer in someone else\u2019s. Synchronising on it is impossible. What you have to do is provide the process with enough and more time so that no unexpected delay will cause the project to fail.<\/p>\n<p>This is just an example of what could go wrong when you are getting ready for the Expo 2020. What you need now is a guide for applying for UAE Visas. This is an activity for a professional to take over from you. Don\u2019t take it in the wrong way. Each one has a forte. Your staffing partner\u2019s would be to ensure that you get all the right documents at the right time so that your travel plans including tickets, visa and stay arrangements are processed without a hassle.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the guide.<\/p>\n<p>Visa is the international travel document that enables you to travel outside of the national boundaries. This mandatory document is key to any travel, business or personal. The visa has been categorised into various types and is charged differently depending on the needs and the usage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of Visa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>VISIT VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nThe validity for this visa is 60 days. This permits the entry of an individual into the country. The period for the permission can be extended up to 90 days.<br \/>\nAED 165 is being charged for the Visit Visa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>TOURIST VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nA tourist visa is issued with the intention to allow the visitor to get a chance to explore the UAE in all its glory.

The validity period is 16 days.<br \/>\nAED 200 is being charged for the Special Mission Visa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>TRANSIT VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nTransit Visas are issued for travellers who stopover in the UAE while passing through to another destination. The Dubai International Airport provides the transit visa for 96 hours. The minimum period for which this is issued is 8 hours.<br \/>\nAED 44 is being charged for the transit visa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>MULTIPLE ENTRY VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nMultiple entries are permitted with this visa. During the validity period of 90 days, the holder can visit the country multiple times.<br \/>\nAED 1655 is being charged for the multiple entry visa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>INVESTOR VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nFormation of a company is permitted with the Investor Visa. The validity of this visa is 3 years. An initial deposit of AED 10,000 to 20,000 is required.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>EMPLOYMENT VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nThe work visa permits entry for working professionals. 18 years is the minimum age limit to obtain this visa.<br \/>\nAED 1200 is being charged for the employment visa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>RESIDENT VISA<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nThe resident visa is issued to only those with a passport that is valid for a minimum duration of six months.<br \/>\nAED 120 is charged for a 1-year resident visa and AED 360 for three years.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the above said amounts are approximate and are subject to change. Kindly refer https:\/\/www.mofa.gov.ae\/EN\/ConsularServices\/Pages\/Visa-Information.aspx for updated information.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The documents required are as follows<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Visa application duly filled and signed<br \/>\nCopy of bank statement showing past month\u2019s transactions<br \/>\nPassport with minimum 6 months validity from the date of entry into the country<br \/>\nDetails of the travel, residential address and copy of the return ticket<br \/>\nTraveller\u2019s passport size photo (2 nos) with white background<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to keep an eye on how things can go wrong while applying for UAE Visas. Behind every rejected Visa stands a real reason. Knowing about not just what will work but also the common mistakes to avoid will increase your chances of getting your visa approved.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the previously held residence visa is not cancelled while leaving the country, there can be an issue.<\/li>\n<li>Hand written passports are rejected by the UAE Immigration<\/li>\n<li>Previously applied employment or tourist visa but not utilized (did not enter the country) can raise doubts.<\/li>\n<li>Typo errors in the visa (name \/ passport number \/ profession code) calls for immediate rejection or delay.<\/li>\n<li>Blurred images on the passport are frowned upon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While these are some of the reasons why your visa could get rejected, do keep in mind that the UAE immigration might not give you any reason for rejecting your visa. Knowing what could go wrong can help you avoid rejections.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Ministry of Labour and Immigration rules, you are allowed to stay for 30 days after the cancellation or the expiry of the visa in order to complete the necessary remaining work for the new visa. Expiry of the grace period of 30 days will lead to a hefty fine.<\/p>\n<p>While these are the details regarding the paperwork that you need to gain entry into the UAE, the process can get very tedious. A miss and you can miss the expo altogether. While having the guide to applying for UAE visas is a must, employing the services of a professional to ensure that the journey is hassle-free is common sense. What do you have to prove? The travel experts at Future Focus Infotech will give you a suitable package that will ensure a smooth travel and safe return.<\/p>\n<p>Create the future by being ready for the present.
